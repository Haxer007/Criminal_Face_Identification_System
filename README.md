# Criminal Face Recognition System
## Introduction:
**What is Face Identification System?**

A Face Identificatiion System is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital
image or a video frame against a database of faces.

**Usage:**
This Face Identification System can be trained to identify criminal faces which can be
implemented into the Security System to detect the criminal faces.This system can be used in
ATM cameras and Street cameras to detect the criminals, if the face of the criminal or suspect
is in the database of Police Department.

The working of code can be boiled down to three main processes namely :
 - **Training the LBPH model** 
 - **Detecting Faces in Video Feed**
 - **Recognizing faces via trained LBPH model**  



 The process of identification is based on face recognition, which is further divided into
 three steps:
- **Training Data Collection:** Gather face data (face images in this case) of the persons you want to recognize
- **Training of Recognizer:** Feed that face data (and respective names of each face) to the face recognizer so that it can learn.
- **Recognition:** Feed new faces of the persons and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.
